          <h3>Executive delivery at scale</h3>
          <p>Abcam: VP Global Engineering at a life sciences unicorn, unlocking the double-digit growth the company had been promising its market for five years. Travis Perkins: Group Director, building software delivery across 200 people including crisis management during the Ukraine conflict. Cybersafe Schools: CEO. UK Government: at GDS, eliminating paper driving licences for 60 million users. At ESFA, delivering the digital Apprenticeship Levy saving £2.7 billion annually. At HMRC, introducing agile delivery and DevOps across the Aspire programme.</p>
          <p class="credentials-inline">The scale has always been large. The problems have always been structural. The people have always been a big part of the solution.</p>

          <h3>Beò Lab</h3>
          <p>My research into digital wellbeing and the attention economy directly informs my executive work. Understanding what constant connectivity actually costs organisations makes me a more effective CIO. As CTO of Beò Lab, I set the technical direction while the research team handles operations.</p>
