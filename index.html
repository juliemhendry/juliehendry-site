          <h3>Executive delivery at scale</h3>
          <p>Abcam: VP Engineering at an AIM-listed life sciences company, creating their first unified technology portfolio and delivering the engineering transformation after four consecutive years of double-digit growth stalled entering a fifth. Travis Perkins: Group Director, bringing together all brands under a single software delivery function for the first time. Led crisis management during the Ukraine conflict. Cognizant: Director of Delivery. Cybersafe Schools: CEO. UK Government: at GDS, coaching the teams delivering the Exemplar programme that replaced paper driving licence counterparts for 40 million licence holders. At ESFA, delivering the digital Apprenticeship Service managing the distribution of £2.7 billion in annual levy funds. At HMRC, agile delivery and dev tooling within the Aspire programme.</p>
          <p class="credentials-inline">The scale has always been large. The problems have always been structural. The people have always been a big part of the solution.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://beo.llc">beò</a></h3>
          <p>beò is a B2B company measuring the cognitive impact of AI adoption on workforces. The founding research (Hendry, 2020, n=82) found that a widely used smartphone usage scale failed to predict actual device behaviour (r = .198, ns): the same measurement gap organisations face with AI. Understanding what AI actually does to the way people think, decide, and collaborate makes for a more credible technology leader in AI transformation conversations.</p>

          <h3>Interim and fractional CIO</h3>
          <p>Full ownership of the technology estate, accountable to the board. I take on interim and fractional CIO positions where the organisation needs someone to diagnose what's actually broken, build the right team around it, and stay until it's fixed.</p>

        <h4>Travis Perkins (FTSE 250)</h4>
        <p>Brought together all the group's brands under a single software delivery function for the first time, building capability across UK and Ukraine. When the conflict began, led the evacuation of 100 team members while maintaining delivery continuity. Geopolitical risk, stakeholder communication, and operational resilience simultaneously.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="case-highlight">
        <h4>Abcam (AIM-listed, £260M revenue)</h4>
        <p>Owned delivery, engineering, and operations across four countries. Created the business's first unified technology portfolio. Integrated with Oracle Cloud ERP. AWS migration reducing costs by 40%. Unlocked the double-digit growth Abcam had delivered for four consecutive years but was stuck entering its fifth.</p>
