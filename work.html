        <h3>Interim and Fractional CIO</h3>
        <p>Interim and fractional CIO with full ownership of the technology estate, accountable to the board. I take on roles where the organisation needs someone to diagnose what's actually broken, build the right team around it, and stay until it's fixed.</p>
        <p>Interim engagements typically run 6 to 18 months with full-time exclusivity and executive accountability. Fractional engagements suit organisations that need senior technology leadership but not a full-time hire. Both start the same way: understanding the problem before proposing the solution.</p>
        <p>Every engagement starts with a diagnostic. What's actually broken? Is it the technology, the team, the governance, the stakeholder relationships, or all four? The first 30 days are about listening, mapping, and understanding before prescribing. I report directly to boards and executive teams on technology risk, investment, and delivery, translating complexity into business impact. Quick wins where they exist, but the real work is structural.</p>
        <p>Organisations I've worked with include GDS, Cabinet Office, HMRC, ESFA, Abcam, Cognizant, Travis Perkins, Cybersafe Schools, American Express, JP Morgan, BBC, Barclays, Tesco, Sky, The Guardian, Royal London, Ordnance Survey, and Sungard. The scale has always been large. The stakes have always been real.</p>

        <h3>Crisis and Transformation</h3>
        <p>At Travis Perkins (FTSE 250), I brought together all the group's brands under a single software delivery function for the first time, building capability across UK and Ukraine operations. When the Ukraine conflict began, I led the evacuation of 100 team members while maintaining delivery continuity. The board needed someone who could manage geopolitical risk, stakeholder communication, and operational resilience simultaneously. That's what interim CIO work actually looks like when it matters.</p>
        <p>At Abcam (AIM-listed life sciences company, £260M revenue), I owned delivery, engineering, and operations across four countries. Abcam had delivered double-digit growth for four consecutive years but was stuck entering its fifth. I led the engineering transformation that helped unlock it through specific technical decisions: I created the business's first unified technology portfolio, enabling prioritisation of high-value projects to modernise the legacy stack. That included integrating with Oracle Cloud ERP, migrating to AWS (reducing operating costs by 40%), and developing technology partnerships for the Chinese market as we built out the China IT division.</p>

        <h3>Transformation Consulting</h3>
        <p>Thirty years of going into organisations that are stuck and working out what's actually wrong. Financial services, government, life sciences, media. The common thread is complexity: situations where the standard consulting playbook doesn't work because the problem isn't standard.</p>
        <p>I start with people, understand the politics, design the structures, then worry about the process. It's slower to start and faster to finish than the alternative.</p>

        <h3>beò</h3>
        <p>beò is a B2B company measuring the cognitive impact of AI adoption on workforces. The founding research found near-zero correlation between standard technology questionnaires and actual usage behaviour. Organisations deploying AI are making the same measurement mistake. beò was built to close that gap. The research directly informs my executive work: understanding what AI actually does to the way people think, decide, and collaborate makes for a more credible CIO.</p>
