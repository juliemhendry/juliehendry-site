      "date": "5 February 2026",
      "excerpt": "In 2020, I ran my MSc research convinced I'd prove everyone was addicted to their phones. The BSMAS \"addiction\" scores showed weak correlation with actual social media screen time (r = .12). The addiction framing measures psychological distress about technology.

      "excerpt": "Ask someone how often they check social media and they'll tell you with reasonable accuracy.

And it's the reason most digital wellbeing interventions don't work.",
