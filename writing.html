        <h3>Why I'm Running Research, Not Building a Startup</h3>
        <p>People ask me why I'm not raising money for Beò. I spent over twenty years building technology at scale for organisations like Abcam, Travis Perkins, JP Morgan, and the UK Government. I know how to ship product. That's precisely why I'm not shipping one yet.</p>
        <p>The digital wellbeing space is full of apps built on assumptions. Screen time trackers that assume less is better. "Digital detox" tools that assume abstinence works. Notification blockers that assume the problem is volume. Most of them cite research that doesn't actually predict behaviour (my own MSc data showed this: "addiction" scores had almost no correlation with actual phone use).</p>
        <p>I don't want to build another product on bad assumptions. I want to know whether the hypothesis holds first. Can evidence-based microhabits actually shift how people feel about their relationship with technology? The honest answer: I don't know. There's a real chance we find no significant effect. That's what pre-registered research is for.</p>
        <p>If the data shows something meaningful, the build-and-operate phase is someone else's job. I'm a technology executive, not a startup operator. My curiosity is about whether the problem is solvable. If it is, the right team to scale it is an engineering and product team, not a researcher with a hypothesis.</p>
        <p>Beò is a four-week research commitment. As CTO I set the technical direction, but the research team handles day-to-day operations. The work keeps me honest about what technology actually does to people, which makes me better at the executive roles where I spend the rest of my time.</p>
        <p>I'd rather run a study that finds nothing than ship a product that assumes everything.</p>

        <h3>Why I Stopped Chasing 'Addiction'</h3>
        <p>In 2020, I ran my MSc research convinced I'd prove everyone was addicted to their phones. I used multiple validated measures and collected actual iPhone Screen Time data. I was ready.</p>
        <p>The "addiction" scores showed weak correlation with actual social media screen time (r = .12). But simply asking "how often do you check social media?" correlated well (r = .54). People weren't in denial. They could report their social media frequency fairly accurately. But the distress measured by "addiction" scales wasn't the same as how much they actually used it.</p>
        <p>The addiction framing measures psychological distress about technology. But distress isn't the same as behaviour. You can feel terrible about your phone while using it moderately. You can feel fine while scrolling for hours.</p>
        <p>In 2023, researchers validated the Digital Flourishing Scale. Instead of measuring pathology, it measures whether technology supports meaningful relationships, authentic self-expression, and sense of purpose. The question shifted from "how broken are you?" to "is technology helping you live well?"</p>
        <p>That shift changed everything about how I built Beò. My 2020 self would have built another shame-based app showing scary numbers. Instead, Beò asks whether you feel in control of your digital life, and whether simple microhabits can shift that feeling.</p>
        <p>I'm using the latest validated measures (2023, peer-reviewed, published in Journal of Happiness Studies). The older framework led me to findings that didn't make sense. When better tools exist, use them. We're pre-registering our hypotheses, acknowledging our limitations, and sharing what we find, including what doesn't work. That's the kind of research I want to do.</p>

        <h3>The 10 to 6 Effect</h3>
        <p>Many years ago I had the fortunate experience of working with a hyper-productive and wonderfully lovely team of about 100 people. The first thing that happened was the leaders of the group asked the people to choose their working hours.</p>
        <p>Immediately this group of people had a puzzle to solve. The puzzle had one specific outcome: what times will we be working from tomorrow onwards? There were constraints. Every two weeks everyone had to share their work and plan together between 9am and 5pm. Some wanted flexible hours. Most wanted to work with other people. As the conversations flowed people started discussing their personal needs. Long commutes, picking up kids, rush hour traffic, prayer needs, health problems.</p>
        <p>As humanity and empathy emerged, deep thought and dialogue became infectious. They decided they'd rather work together all the time if they could. The most popular vote was 10am until 6pm. Management accepted. This acceptance initiated the building of trust. It paid off in later iterations when the teams would help each other get stories over the line. It gave everyone permission to ask for what they needed to do the job.</p>
        <p>So I ask you: ditch the theories for a moment, stop looking for methods, and know you cannot force people to change. Try a single, simple act of leadership instead.</p>

        <h3>Learning Together Creates a Better Future</h3>
        <p>Some volunteers arrived in a small village in Africa. Their aim? To tackle the childhood malnutrition that besieged the area. Others had been before them. People who lectured, people who taught, people who tried their best to get the villagers to do things their way. But the people resisted and no-one knew why.</p>
        <p>A smart young volunteer observed that a few of the local babies seemed well fed. She proceeded to learn the language and communicate with the families. As trust grew, she discovered they would take a local insect and grind it into the milk. The village knew this form of protein was edible, yet deemed it beneath them.</p>
        <p>With the volunteer's help, the mothers of the well-fed children stood up and told their neighbours what they had done. Some courageous first followers tried in secret. Soon the village had much less problems with malnutrition.</p>
        <p>I love this story because it shows how simply taking time to see, and being open to the unthinkable, can make the difference. Even in our world, it is just better to do things with the people involved. Not to them. Be open. Be courageous.</p>
